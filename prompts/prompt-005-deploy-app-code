# Deploy App Code

Create a zip file for the app code so that it can be deployed to Azure in the following manner:

```bash
az webapp deploy \
  --resource-group MyRG \
  --name MyWebApp \
  --src-path ./app.zip
```

Also add the correct terminal command to any deployment scripts you are creating or have created to deploy it.

**Important Requirements:**

1. **Zip File Structure:**
   - Make sure app.zip or any .zip files are not excluded by the gitignore file so you can add the app.zip file to the repo for use later in the script
   - Make sure the app.zip folder unzips to give files at the root level that include the DLL file
   - Do NOT add another folder level in between like publish folder or other
   - **Critical:** You must avoid this issue: "The issue is that the files are in an app/ subdirectory within the zip file. Azure App Service expects the files to be at the root of the zip."

2. **Startup Command:**
   - After deploying, ensure NO startup command is set (should be empty/null)
   - If a startup command exists, clear it with: `az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <rg> --startup-file ""`
   - The .NET runtime will automatically find and execute the DLL without a startup command

3. **User Information:**
   - Make it clear to the user somewhere that the URL to view the app is `<app url>/Index` so they don't just navigate to the root URL

**Common Issues to Avoid:**

- Do NOT set `appCommandLine` or startup commands like `node server.js` - this prevents .NET apps from starting
- Ensure zip file contents are at root level, not in subdirectories
