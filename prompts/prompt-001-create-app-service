# Create App Service

Create the Bicep code needed to deploy an App Service instance to Azure on a low cost development SKU in UKSOUTH.

**Important Requirements:**

1. **Runtime Configuration:**
   - Do NOT set `appCommandLine` or startup command in the Bicep configuration
   - Let Azure automatically detect and start the application based on the runtime stack
   - For .NET applications, the runtime will automatically find and execute the DLL

2. **App Service Plan:**
   - Use a low-cost development SKU (B1 or F1)
   - Location: UKSOUTH

3. **Managed Identity:**
   - Assign the user-assigned managed identity to the App Service
   - Output the App Service's principal ID for role assignments

**Common Issues to Avoid:**

- Setting `appCommandLine` to `node server.js` or any other command - this will prevent .NET apps from starting
- The container will fail with exit code 127 if the startup command references a command not available in the runtime
