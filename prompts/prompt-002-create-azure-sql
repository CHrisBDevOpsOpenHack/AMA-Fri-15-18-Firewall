Create the Bicep code needed to deploy an Azure SQL Database with the following security requirements:

1. **Azure AD-Only Authentication (Required by Policy)**:
   - Set `azureADOnlyAuthentication: true` in the administrators configuration
   - This is a mandatory MCAPS governance policy requirement
   - SQL authentication must be disabled

2. **Entra ID Administrator**:
   - Configure the SQL server with Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication
   - Set the person deploying as the named administrator
   - Include their Object ID and User Principal Name

3. **Managed Identity Access**:
   - Grant the managed identity created earlier access to the server
   - Assign ##MS_DatabaseManager## permissions to the managed identity

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Create a database named 'Northwind'
   - Use Basic tier for development
   - Enable firewall rule for Azure services
   - Enable firewall for client deployment IP Address

5. **Schema Import Using PowerShell Script**:
   - Create a PowerShell script (configure-database.ps1) to run the schema import post-deployment
   - Use sqlcmd with Azure AD authentication: `-U <username> -G -C` flags
   - Do NOT use deployment scripts in Bicep due to Azure Policy restrictions on storage account key-based authentication
   - The PowerShell script should:
     - Get current Azure AD user with `az ad signed-in-user show --query userPrincipalName`
     - Use `sqlcmd -S <server> -d <database> -U <username> -G -C` for authentication
     - Import the database schema with `-i <schema-file>`
     - Grant managed identity permissions with SQL commands
     - Include error handling and connection testing
     - Use -b flag for batch mode to catch errors
   - The deploy.sh script should call the PowerShell script after Bicep deployment completes

**Important Notes**:

- The `azureADOnlyAuthentication` must be set to `true` to comply with the "[SFI-ID4.2.2] SQL DB - Safe Secrets Standard" policy enforced by MCAPS Governance.
- Azure Deployment Scripts cannot be used due to Azure Policy blocking key-based authentication on storage accounts. Use PowerShell script approach instead.
