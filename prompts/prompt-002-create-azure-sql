Create the Bicep code needed to deploy an Azure SQL Database with the following security requirements:

1. **Azure AD-Only Authentication (Required by Policy)**:
   - Set `azureADOnlyAuthentication: true` in the administrators configuration
   - This is a mandatory MCAPS governance policy requirement
   - SQL authentication must be disabled

2. **Entra ID Administrator**:
   - Configure the SQL server with Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication
   - Set the person deploying as the named administrator
   - Include their Object ID and User Principal Name

3. **Managed Identity Access**:
   - Grant the managed identity created earlier access to the server
   - Assign ##MS_DatabaseManager## permissions to the managed identity

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Create a database named 'Northwind'
   - Use Basic tier for development
   - Enable firewall rule for Azure services
   - Enable firewall for client deployment IP Address

5. **Schema Import Using Azure Native Methods**:
   - Create an Azure Deployment Scripts (Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts) in Bicep to run the schema import as part of the infrastructure deployment
   - Uses sqlcmd with Azure AD authentication
   - Import the database schema
   - Grants the already deployed managed identity permissions
   - Includes error handling and connection testing
   - Uses -b flag for batch mode to catch errors

**Important**: The `azureADOnlyAuthentication` must be set to `true` to comply with the "[SFI-ID4.2.2] SQL DB - Safe Secrets Standard" policy enforced by MCAPS Governance.
